This is my course project for the getting and cleaning data.

1. First, download the dataset from web (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Merge the training and test datas respectively into variable x, y and s using rbind() function.
2. Load the data feature, activity info and extract columns "mean" and "standard" from features.txt.
3. Extract data by selected columns, and merge variable x, y and s. 
4. Generate 'tidy_dataset' that consists of the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result file is generated in the working directory named "tidy_dataset.txt"

I can`t speak English very well, but I tried hard on it.
